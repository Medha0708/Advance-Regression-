#Using Lasso and Ridge methods for enhanced regression analysis

The Surprise Housing company, based in the US, has decided to expand its operations to Australia. Utilizing data analytics, they plan to purchase properties at a lower price and resell them for a profit. In order to achieve this goal, they have obtained a dataset containing information on the sale of homes in Australia. Your task is to develop a regression model using regularization techniques, Lasso and Ridge, to predict the true value of potential properties and determine whether they are worth investing in.

The company desires to understand which factors have the greatest impact on determining the price of a home, as well as how effectively these variables can predict the cost. Additionally, you will be determining the optimal value of lambda for both Lasso and Ridge regression.

The ultimate objective is to create a model that can be used by management to comprehend how prices fluctuate in relation to different variables, allowing them to adjust their strategy and focus on areas with high potential returns. Moreover, the model will serve as a valuable tool for the company to gain insight into the pricing dynamics of the Australian housing market."
